## Exercise: Roman numerals
Create a conversion mechanism from integers to a Roman representation (a string):
* 1, 2 and 3 become I, II and III respectively.
* 5 and 10 become V and X respectively.
* 6 become VI, as symbols are additive.
* 4 becomes IV, as symbols are used subtractively (in this case subtracting 1 from 5) to avoid repeating a symbol more than three times in a row.

## Aceptance Criteria
1. The Solution have to can be able to do the conversion from number 1 to 100.

## Rules
* Donâ€™t write any production code before you have a failing test (including compile errors!).
* Make each step as small and simple as possible.
* Commit as soon as you have a passing test.

## Note
Before beginning, clone this repo in your machine and create a new development branch from it with the following name:
   
   `REPLACE_WITH_LION_LOGIN_LOWERCASE-errorhandling-challenge`
   
For example, a valid branch name would it be:
   
   `carmosqu-errorhandling-challenge`
