# HANDS ON - TDD Exercise

## Background
   This following exercise is based on a TDD workshop that I conducted for a client.
   
## Exercise 1: FizzBuzz
   I am going to do an exercise TDD by completing [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). 
   
   Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word `Fizz` and any number divisible by five by the word `Buzz`. Numbers divisible by 15 become `FizzBuzz`.
   
   The exercise is complete when the following input: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30]`
   
   results in the following output:
   
   `[1, 2, Fizz, Buzz, Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, FizzBuzz]`
   
 Rules:
 
 * Donâ€™t write any production code before you have a failing test (including compile errors!).
 * Make each step as small and simple as possible.
 * Commit as soon as you have a passing test.
