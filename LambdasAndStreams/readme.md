![prodigious-logo](Images/prodigious_logo.png)

## Overview ##

This training aims to introduce you to the basics of Functional Programming in JAVA, using Lambdas and Streams. Moreover, you will put some of these concepts into practice by performing a laboratory.

Please use your Lion Login to obtain the **[O'Reilly credentials](https://lion.app.box.com/s/venhn6zsx1dr3lr0b76a880yawsg6q9g)** in order to access the videos beginning in the Lambdas and Streams chapter introduction, found in **[here](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/java-8-fundamentals/9780133489354/9780133489354-JFUN_lesson17_intro)**: 

## Prerequisites and Resources ##

In order to follow the videos correctly, you should have installed the JDK and a Java IDE beforehand. If you have not done so, you can do it for yourself if you know how to do it, but if not, you can follow the following videos, which will walk you trought the installation of both things.

###  JDK and Java IDE installation (**[Installation and setup environment Videos beginning here](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/java-8-fundamentals/9780133489354/9780133489354-JFUN_BYB01)**) ###

The recommended IDE to use is IntelliJ IDEA, but if you want to use Eclipse or Netbeans you can do it too. Just follow instructions on the installation video choosing between their respective videos.

   * Overview
   * Software Used
   * Installing the JDK (Required) : In this video you can choose between installing just the JDK or the Netbeans bundle, depending on the IDE that you are going to use
   * Installing Eclipse (Optional)
   * Installing IntelliJ IDEA (Optional)
