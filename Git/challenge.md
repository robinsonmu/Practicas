## Exercise: New Project
Once you have completed the exercises in the page above. As part of this exercise evaluation you will need to create a repository that has the following criteria:
* Have a master, development and release branch.
* Have merge commit
* Have rebased commits
* Have conflict resolution commits.

## Steps

### In order to evaluate the commits, push and merges:

1. Create an empty repository and initialize it(This will by itself create the master branch).
2. Create the development branch and push it to a remote(have an active github account for this).
3. Create at least one feature branch.
4. Commit twice to the feature branch and push it.
5. Merge the commit branch into the develop branch and the push it.

### In order to evaluate the rebase of the branches
1. Create a brand new feature branch 
2. Commit to the newly created branch.
3. Commit three times to the feature and push it.
4. Rebase the Develop branch into the master branch.
5. ag the master branch with a tag name 1.0.0.

## Note
Before beginning, clone this repo in your machine and create a new development branch from it with the following name:
   
   `REPLACE_WITH_LION_LOGIN_LOWERCASE-git-challenge`
   
For example, a valid branch name would it be:
   
   `carmosqu-git-challenge`
